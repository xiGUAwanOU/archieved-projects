# Archieved Projects
Graveyard for dead projects.

## Game Project 01
A simple squirrel jump game, basically a copy of the Chrome T-Rex game.

## Jackson Dataformat Yaml
Fixed a bug in this library. This is the first time I was contributing to an open-source project.

## Poker Hands Comparision
The trail task of my first job. Implementation of a set of rules to compare two poker hands. Sounds quite simple, but it is very easy to produce spaghetti code here.
