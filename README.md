# Archieved Projects
Graveyard for dead projects.

## Basic Ruby Project
From now on I'll reduce the usage of Ruby language. Personally I think Ruby is definitely a wonderful, elegant language, but it is not a handy tool. A handy tool for me is not full of magic, not full of creativity, but strong, robust and explicit. I'd like to put my creativities on the final product, not on the source codes.

## Game Project 01
A simple squirrel jump game, basically a copy of the Chrome T-Rex game.

## Jackson Dataformat Yaml
Fixed a bug in this library. This is the first time I was contributing to an open-source project.

## Joyful Utilities
The Ruby implementation of this library. The implementation is very successful, but the project using it is not, because of the same reason as the Basic Ruby Project mentioned above.

## Poker Hands Comparision
The trail task of my first job. Implementation of a set of rules to compare two poker hands. Sounds quite simple, but it is very easy to produce spaghetti code here.

## Text-based game
It is not dead, currently Game Project 02, re-writing it with Java.

## Joyful World
Restored the overview-language project and archieved this one, because it seems that a new programming language is not avoidable.
